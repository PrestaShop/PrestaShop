ABOUT
--------

PrestaShop is a free and open-source e-commerce web application, committed to providing the best shopping cart experience for both merchants and consumers.


SERVER CONFIGURATION
--------

To install PrestaShop, you need a web server running PHP5 and any flavor of MySQL5 (MySQL, MariaDB, Percona Server...).
You will also need a database administration tool, such as phpMyAdmin, in order to create a database for PrestaShop.
We recommend the Apache or Nginx web servers.

If your host does not offer PHP5 by default, here are a few [explanations][2] about PHP5 or the .htaccess file for certain hosting services (1&1, Free, Lycos, OVH, Infomaniak, Amen, GoDaddy, etc).

If you want your online store ready to go, visit [http://www.prestabox.com][1]: it lets you create your online store in less than 10 minutes without any technical knowledge.


INSTALLATION
--------

With your web browser, go to the root of your PrestaShop directory, and the installer will start. Follow the instructions until PrestaShop is installed.

If you have any PHP error, perhaps you don't have PHP5 or you need to activate it on your web host. See the page linked above.
If you don't find any solution to start the installer, please post on [the PrestaShop forums][3].


DOCUMENTATION
--------

The official PrestaShop documentation is available online [on its own website][4].


FORUMS
--------
