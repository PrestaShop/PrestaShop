        <source>When managing a website, it is important to keep track of the software used by visitors so as to be sure that the site displays the same way for everyone. PrestaShop was built to be compatible with the most recent Web browsers and computer operating systems (OS). However, because you may end up adding advanced features to your website or even modifying the core PrestaShop code, these additions may not be accessible to everyone. That is why it is a good idea to keep track of the percentage of users for each type of software before adding or changing something that only a limited number of users will be able to access.</source>
