URI.MakeAbsolute
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 2.1.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--

<p>
    Converts all URIs into absolute forms. This is useful when the HTML
    being filtered assumes a specific base path, but will actually be
    viewed in a different context (and setting an alternate base URI is
    not possible). %URI.Base must be set for this directive to work.
