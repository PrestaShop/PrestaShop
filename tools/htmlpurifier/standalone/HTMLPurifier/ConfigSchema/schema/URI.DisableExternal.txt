URI.DisableExternal
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 1.2.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--
Disables links to external websites.  This is a highly effective anti-spam
and anti-pagerank-leech measure, but comes at a hefty price: nolinks or
images outside of your domain will be allowed.  Non-linkified URIs will
still be preserved.  If you want to be able to link to subdomains or use
absolute URIs, specify %URI.Host for your website.
