HTML.SafeIframe
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 4.4.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--
<p>
    Whether or not to permit iframe tags in untrusted documents.  This
    directive must be accompanied by a whitelist of permitted iframes,
    such as %URI.SafeIframeRegexp, otherwise it will fatally error.
    This directive has no effect on strict doctypes, as iframes are not
    valid.
