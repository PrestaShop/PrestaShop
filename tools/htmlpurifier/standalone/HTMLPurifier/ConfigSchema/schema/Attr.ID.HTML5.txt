Attr.ID.HTML5
TYPE: bool/null
DEFAULT: null
VERSION: 4.8.0
--DESCRIPTION--
In HTML5, restrictions on the format of the id attribute have been significantly
relaxed, such that any string is valid so long as it contains no spaces and
is at least one character.  In lieu of a general HTML5 compatibility flag,
set this configuration directive to true to use the relaxed rules.
