# [Bootstrap v3.0.0](http://getbootstrap.com) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/bootstrap)

Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat).

To get started, check out [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)!



## Quick start

Three quick start options are available:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master).
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git`.
* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io): `bower install bootstrap`.

Read the [Getting Started page](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) for information on the framework contents, templates and examples, and more.



## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? [Please open a new issue](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues and read the [Issue Guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines), written by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas/).



## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the `/docs` directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at [http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com). The docs maybe also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v1.x).
2. From the `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
3. Open [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in your browser, and voil√†.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading their [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### Documentation for previous releases

Documentation for v2.3.2 has been made available for the time being at [http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/docs](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/docs) while folks transition to Bootstrap 3.

For previous releases, documentation is available for [download via Git tags](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tags).



## Compiling CSS and JavaScript

Bootstrap includes a [makefile](Makefile) with convenient methods for working with the framework. Before getting started, install [the necessary local dependencies](package.json):

```
$ npm install
```

When completed, you'll be able to run the various make commands provided.

### Available makefile commands

#### Build - `make`
`make` runs the Recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compile the docs. **Requires recess and uglify-js.**

#### Compile CSS, JS, and fonts - `make bootstrap`
`make bootstrap` creates the `/bootstrap` directory with compiled files. **Requires recess and uglify-js.**

#### Tests - `make test`
Runs jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). **Requires phantomjs.**

#### Watch - `make watch`
This is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. **Requires the watchr gem.**

### Troubleshooting dependencies

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running makefile commands, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
