/**
 * This component is bound to any Create product button (via a class selector). On button click

 * select the product type (and maybe initial shop) and then you can submit the form.
 *
 * Once the creation succeeds, the edition form is displayed, at this moment this component catches
 * the refresh event from the iframe and gets the product ID from the edit form data attributes.
 *
 * Finally, it opens the edition page of the created product in the current tab.
