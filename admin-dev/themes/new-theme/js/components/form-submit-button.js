/**
 * Component which allows submitting very simple forms without having to use <form> element.
 *
 * Useful when performing actions on resource where URL contains all needed data.
 * For example, to toggle category status via "POST /categories/2/toggle-status)"
 * or delete cover image via "POST /categories/2/delete-cover-image".
 *
 * Usage example in template:
 *
 * <button class="js-form-submit-btn"
 *         data-form-submit-url="/my-custom-url"          // (required) URL to which form will be submitted
 *         data-form-csrf-token="my-generated-csrf-token" // (optional) to increase security
 *         type="button"                                  // make sure its simple button
 *                                                        // so we can avoid submitting actual form
 *                                                        // when our button is defined inside form
 * >
 *     Click me to submit form
 * </button>
 *
 * In page specific JS you have to enable this feature:
 *
 * new FormSubmitButton();
