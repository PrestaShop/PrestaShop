/**
 * Component which allows to copy regular text to url friendly text
 *
 * Usage example in template:
 *
 * <input name="source-input" class="js-link-rewrite-copier-source"> // The original text will be taken from this element
 * <input name="destination-input" class="js-link-rewrite-copier-destination"> // Modified text will be added to this input
 *
 * in javascript:
 *
 * textToLinkRewriteCopier({
 *   sourceElementSelector: '.js-link-rewrite-copier-source'
 *   destinationElementSelector: '.js-link-rewrite-copier-destination',
 * });
 *
 * If the source-input has value "test name" the link rewrite value will be "test-name".
 * If the source-input has value "test name #$" link rewrite will be "test-name-" since #$ are un allowed characters in url.
 *
 * You can also pass additional options to change the event name, or encoding format:
 *
 * textToLinkRewriteCopier({
 *   sourceElementSelector: '.js-link-rewrite-copier-source'
 *   destinationElementSelector: '.js-link-rewrite-copier-destination',
 *   options: {
 *     eventName: 'change', // default is 'input'
 *   }
 * });
 *
