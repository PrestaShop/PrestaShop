Guidelines:

* Don't target the 'master' branch!
* Make sure your local branch is up to date before commiting your changes!
* The PR of your title and the name of your commit should match the PrestaShop naming convention: http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+write+a+commit+message
* Use 'git rebase' (in the command line) to squash/fixup dummy/unnecessary commits into only one commit, or to remove "Merge branch XXX:" commits.

Please be as descriptive as possible: the more details you give, the quicker your PR can be merged!

IMPORTANT: Your code MUST respect the PSR-2 Coding Style: http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Coding+Standards !
