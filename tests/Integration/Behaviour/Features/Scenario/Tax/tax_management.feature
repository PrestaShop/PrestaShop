Feature: Manage tax
  As a employee
  I must be able to correctly add, edit and delete tax

  Scenario: Adding new tax
    When I add new tax "tax-1" with following properties:
      | name         | my custom tax 500 |
      | rate         | 0.5               |
      | is_enabled   | 1                 |
    Then tax "tax-1" name in default language should be "my custom tax 500"
    And tax "tax-1" rate should be 0.500
    And tax "tax-1" should be enabled

  Scenario: Adding new tax with empty name should not be allowed
    When I add new tax "tax-2" with empty name
    Then I should get error message 'Tax contains invalid field values'

  Scenario: Editing tax
    When I edit tax "tax-1" with following properties:
      | name         | my custom tax 300 |
      | rate         | 0.15              |
      | is_enabled   | 0                 |
    Then tax "tax-1" name in default language should be "my custom tax 300"
    And tax "tax-1" rate should be 0.150
    And tax "tax-1" should be disabled

  Scenario: Editing tax when providing only changeable property should be allowed
    When I edit tax "tax-1" with following properties:
      | name        | tax for fun       |
    Then tax "tax-1" name in default language should be "tax for fun"
    And tax "tax-1" rate should be 0.150
    And tax "tax-1" should be disabled

  Scenario: Deleting tax
    Given Tax with id "2" exists
    When I delete tax with id "2"
    Then Tax with id "2" should not exist
