Feature: Carrier management
  PrestaShop allows BO users to manage carrier for shipping
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create, edit and delete carriers

  Background:
    Given group "visitor" named "Visitor" exists
    Given group "guest" named "Guest" exists
    Given I add new zone "zone1" with following properties:
      | name    | zone1 |
      | enabled | true  |
    Given I add new zone "zone2" with following properties:
      | name    | zone2 |
      | enabled | true  |
    And language "en" with locale "en-US" exists
    And language "fr" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one

  Scenario: Adding new Carrier
    When I create carrier "carrier1" with specified properties:
      | name             | Carrier 1                          |
      | grade            | 1                                  |
      | trackingUrl      | http://example.com/track.php?num=@ |
      | active           | true                               |
      | max_width        | 1454                               |
      | max_height       | 1234                               |
      | max_depth        | 1111                               |
      | max_weight       | 3864                               |
      | group_access     | visitor, guest                     |
      | delay[en-US]     | Shipping delay                     |
      | delay[fr-FR]     | Délai de livraison                 |
      | shippingHandling | false                              |
      | isFree           | true                               |
      | shippingMethod   | weight                             |
      | zones            | zone1                              |
      | rangeBehavior    | disabled                           |
    Then carrier "carrier1" should have the following properties:
      | name             | Carrier 1                          |
      | grade            | 1                                  |
      | trackingUrl      | http://example.com/track.php?num=@ |
      | position         | 4                                  |
      | active           | true                               |
      | max_width        | 1454                               |
      | max_height       | 1234                               |
      | max_depth        | 1111                               |
      | max_weight       | 3864                               |
      | group_access     | visitor, guest                     |
      | delay[en-US]     | Shipping delay                     |
      | delay[fr-FR]     | Délai de livraison                 |
      | shippingHandling | false                              |
      | isFree           | true                               |
      | shippingMethod   | weight                             |
      | rangeBehavior    | disabled                           |
      | zones            | zone1                              |
      | ordersCount      | 0                                  |
    Then carrier "carrier1" shouldn't have a logo

  Scenario: Partially editing carrier with name and with an order linked
    Given email sending is disabled
    Given the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart                 |
      | message             | test                       |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment              |
      | status              | Awaiting bank wire payment |
    When I create carrier "carrier1" with specified properties:
      | name             | Carrier 1                          |
      | grade            | 1                                  |

      | rangeBehavior    | disabled                           |
    When I update order "bo_order1" Tracking number to "TEST1234" and Carrier to "carrier1"
    Then order "bo_order1" has Tracking number "TEST1234"
    When I edit carrier "carrier1" with specified properties I get a new carrier referenced as "newCarrier1":
      | name | Carrier 1 new |
    Then carrier "carrier1" should have the following properties:
      | name        | Carrier 1 |
      | ordersCount | 1         |
    Then carrier "newCarrier1" should have the following properties:
      | name        | Carrier 1 new |
      | ordersCount | 0             |

  Scenario: Partially editing carrier with name and without an order linked

    When I edit carrier "carrier1" with specified properties I get a similar carrier called "newCarrier1":

    Then carrier "carrier1" should have the following properties:
