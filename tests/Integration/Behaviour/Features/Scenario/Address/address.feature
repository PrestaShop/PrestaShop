Feature: Address
  PrestaShop allows BO users to manage addresses
  As a BO user
  I should be able to customize addresses

  Background:
    #  from the user point of view manufacturer is brand
    Given I add new manufacturer "testBrand" with following properties:
      | name             | testBrand                          |
      | short_description| Makes best shoes in Europe         |
      | description      | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amets ornare |
      | meta_title       | Perfect quality shoes              |
      | meta_description |                                    |
      | meta_keywords    | Boots, shoes, slippers             |
      | enabled          | true                               |
