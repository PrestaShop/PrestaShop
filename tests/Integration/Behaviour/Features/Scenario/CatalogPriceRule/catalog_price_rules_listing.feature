  As an employee
  I need to be able to see all catalog price rules in product page

  Background:

    And shop "testShop" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And country "UnitedStates" with iso code "US" exists
    And group "visitor" named "Visitor" exists
    And category "home" in default language named "Home" exists
    And category "home" is the default one
    And category "women" in default language named "Women" exists
    And category "accessories" in default language named "Accessories" exists
    And manufacturer studioDesign named "Studio Design" exists
    And attribute group "Color" named "Color" in en language exists
    And attribute "Red" named "Red" in en language exists
    And attribute "Blue" named "Blue" in en language exists

  Scenario: I can see a list of catalog price rules
    Given I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | dress    |
      | type        | standard |
    And I add product "product2" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | skirt    |
      | type        | standard |
    And I add catalog price rule "catalogPriceRuleReference1" with following details:
      | name            | catalog price rule 1 |
      | currency        | usd                  |

      | price           | 50                   |
    Then catalog price rule "catalogPriceRuleReference1" should have following details:
      | catalog price rule detail | value                |
      | name                      | catalog price rule 1 |

#  Here I keep adding conditions to catalog price rules and make product1 satisfy that condition.
#  So catalog price rule list should stay the same for product1 and keep getting smaller for product2
  Scenario: I can see correctly with category condition
    When I add following conditions to catalog price rule "catalogPriceRuleReference1":
      | type     | value |
      | category | women |
    And I assign product product1 to following categories:

  Scenario: I can see correctly with supplier condition
    When I add new supplier supplier1 with the following properties:
