  As a BO user
  I need to be able to add discounts to existing orders from the BO

  Background:
    Given the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And customer "testCustomer" has an empty cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" delivery and invoice address country for customer "testCustomer" is "US"
    And cart dummy_cart delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" is in "Florida" state of "US" country
