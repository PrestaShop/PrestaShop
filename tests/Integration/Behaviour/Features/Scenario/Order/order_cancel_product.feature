    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I update quantity of product "Mug The best is yet to come" in the cart "dummy_cart" to 5
    And I update quantity of product "Mug Today is a good day" in the cart "dummy_cart" to 3
    And I add 2 customized products with reference "demo_14" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I watch the stock of product "Mug The best is yet to come"
    And I watch the stock of product "Mug Today is a good day"

    Given shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1
    And there is a product in the catalog named "Test Product Cart Rule On Order" with a price of 15.0 and 100 items in stock
    Given there is a cart rule named "CartRuleAmountOnWholeOrder" that applies a percent discount of 50.0% with priority 1, quantity of 1000 and quantity per user 1000
    And cart rule "CartRuleAmountOnWholeOrder" is applied on every order
    When I add products to order "bo_order_cancel_product" with new invoice and the following products details:
      | name          | Test Product Cart Rule On Order |
      | amount        | 1                               |
      | price         | 15                              |
    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should have 11 products in total
    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should contain 1 product "Test Product Cart Rule On Order"
    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should have 1 cart rule
    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should have cart rule "CartRuleAmountOnWholeOrder" with amount "$69.00"

    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should have 10 products in total
    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should contain 0 product "Test Product Cart Rule On Order"
    # This one works by chance because the cart rules are not cleaned at all, but once they are it still should be present
    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should have 1 cart rule
#    Then order "bo_order_cancel_product" should have cart rule "CartRuleAmountOnWholeOrder" with amount "$47.60"
    # This test doesn't work because cart rules are not updated in cart nor in order
    # @todo This should be fixed along with #19717
