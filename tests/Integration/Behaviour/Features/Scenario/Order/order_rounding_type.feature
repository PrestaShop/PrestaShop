Feature: In BO, get right display prices for products and totals, depending on the order's rounding type
  As a BO user, I need to get see the right prices depending on rounding type with odd tax

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "FR" is enabled
    And I add new tax "odd-tax" with following properties:
      | name         | Odd Tax (21%) |
      | rate         | 21            |
      | is_enabled   | true          |
    And I add the tax rule group "odd-tax-group" for the tax "odd-tax" with the following conditions:
      | name         | Odd Tax (21%) |
      | country      | FR            |
    And there is a product in the catalog named "Test Product With Odd Tax" with a price of 7.80 and 100 items in stock
    And I set tax rule group "odd-tax-group" to product "Test Product With Odd Tax"
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And price display method for the group of the customer having email "pub@prestashop.com" is "tax included"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "FR" country

  Scenario: Check prices of an order's product as seen in BO when rounding type is per line
    Given specific shop configuration for "rounding type" is set to round each line
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "FR" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 80 products "Test Product With Odd Tax" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And a carrier "price_carrier" with name "My cheap carrier" exists
    And I enable carrier "price_carrier"
    And I associate the tax rule group "odd-tax-group" to carrier "price_carrier"
    And I select carrier "price_carrier" for cart "dummy_cart"
    And cart "dummy_cart" should have "price_carrier" as a carrier
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart                 |
      | message             | test                       |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment              |
      | status              | Awaiting bank wire payment |

      | original_product_price      | 7.80   |
      | unit_price_tax_incl         | 9.438  |
      | unit_price_tax_excl         | 7.80   |
      | total_price_tax_excl        | 624.00 |
