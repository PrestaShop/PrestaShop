Feature: Order from Back Office (BO)
  In order to manage orders for FO customers
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to customize orders from the BO

  #  todo: fix the failing scenarios/code
  #  todo: make scenarios independent
  #  todo: change legacy classes with domain where possible
  #  todo: increase code re-use

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    #    todo: improve context to accept EditableCurrency|ReferenceCurrency instead of legacy Currency object
    #    todo: use domain GetCurrencyForEditing|GetReferenceCurrency to add currency to context
    And the current currency is "USD"
    #    todo: use domain context for Country
    And country "US" is enabled
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    #    todo: use domain context to get employee when is merged: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/16757
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
     #    todo: use domain context to get customer: GetCustomerForViewing;
     #    todo: find a way how to get customer object/id by its properties without using legacy objects
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And a carrier "default_carrier" with name "My carrier" exists
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    #    todo: find a way to create country without legacy object
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart                 |
      | message             | test                       |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment              |
      | status              | Awaiting bank wire payment |

  Scenario: Check customer message can be null
    When I create an empty cart "dummy_cart2" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart2"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart2"
    And I add order "bo_order2" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart2                 |
      | message             |                             |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment               |
      | status              | Awaiting bank wire payment  |
    Then order "bo_order2" must have no customer message

  Scenario: Check customer message is saved when creating an order
    When I create an empty cart "dummy_cart2" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart2"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart2"
    And I add order "bo_order2" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart2                 |
      | message             | test                       |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment              |
      | status              | Awaiting bank wire payment |
    Then order "bo_order2" must have customer message with content "test"
