Feature: Order from Back Office (BO)
  In order to manage orders for FO customers
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to customize orders from the BO

  #  todo: fix the failing scenarios, make scenarios independent, not use legacy classes as much as possible

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    #    todo: use domain context to get employee
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    #    todo: use domain context to get customer
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country

      | payment module name | dummy_payment       |
      | status              | Payment accepted    |
    Then order "bo_order_for_free_shipping" should have 2 products in total
    And order "bo_order_for_free_shipping" should have free shipping
