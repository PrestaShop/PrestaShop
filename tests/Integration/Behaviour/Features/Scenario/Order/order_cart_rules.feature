Feature: Order from Back Office (BO)
  In order to manage orders for FO customers
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to customize orders from the BO

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
