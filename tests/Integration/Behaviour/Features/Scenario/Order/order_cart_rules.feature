Feature: Order from Back Office (BO)
  In order to manage orders for FO customers
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to customize orders from the BO

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart                 |
      | message             | test                       |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment              |
