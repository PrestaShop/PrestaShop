Feature: Order from Back Office (BO)
  In order to manage orders for FO customers
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to customize orders from the BO even when it has multi shops

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And a carrier "default_carrier" with name "My carrier" exists
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart                 |
      | message             | test                       |
      | payment module name | dummy_payment              |
      | status              | Awaiting bank wire payment |
    # These tests were initially created to ensure the quantity can be updated even in multishop all context,
    # because StockManagementRepository cannot work in a multi shop context, but it is required to create a new
    # product So we force single shop context create the product, then we need to reboot the kernel so that
    # StockManagementRepository is created again in the following steps of the scenario
    And single shop context is loaded
    And there is a product in the catalog named "Test Added Product" with a price of 15.0 and 100 items in stock
    And I reboot kernel
    And multiple shop context is loaded

  Scenario: Update product in order
    When I edit product "Mug The best is yet to come" to order "bo_order1" with following products details:
