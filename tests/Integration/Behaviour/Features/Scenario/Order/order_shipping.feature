Feature: Order from Back Office (BO)
  In order to manage orders for FO customers
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to customize orders from the BO

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And there is a zone named "zone1"
    And there is a zone named "zone2"
    And there is a country named "country1" and iso code "FR" in zone "zone1"
    And there is a country named "country2" and iso code "US" in zone "zone2"
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And a carrier "default_carrier" with name "My carrier" exists
    And a carrier "price_carrier" with name "My cheap carrier" exists
    And a carrier "weight_carrier" with name "My light carrier" exists
    And I create an empty cart "dummy_cart" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I add 2 products "Mug The best is yet to come" to the cart "dummy_cart"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart"

  Scenario: Use a carrier that depends on price, add product to change order total the shipping price should update as well
    Given I select carrier "price_carrier" for cart "dummy_cart"
    Then I should get error that carrier is invalid
    Given I enable carrier "price_carrier"
    And I select carrier "price_carrier" for cart "dummy_cart"
    Then cart "dummy_cart" should have "price_carrier" as a carrier
    And I add order "bo_order1" with the following details:
      | cart                | dummy_cart                 |
