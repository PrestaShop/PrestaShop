  As an employee
  I must be able to add, edit and delete suppliers from Back Office

  Background:

    And language "language1" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And single shop context is loaded

  Scenario: Adding new supplier
    When I add new supplier supplier1 with the following properties:

      | address                 | Donelaicio st. 1   |

      | enabled                 | true               |

      | meta keywords[en-US]    | sup,1              |
      | shops                   | [shop1]            |
    Then supplier supplier1 should have following properties:
      | name                    | my supplier 1      |
      | address                 | Donelaicio st. 1   |

      | shops                   | [shop1]            |
