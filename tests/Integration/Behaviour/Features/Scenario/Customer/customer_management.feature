#Feature: Customer Management
#  PrestaShop allows BO users to manage customers in the Customers > Customers page
#  As a BO user
#  I must be able to create, save and edit customers
#
#  Scenario: Create a simple customer and edit it
#    When I create a customer "CUST-1" with following properties:
#      | firstName | Mathieu                    |
#      | lastName  | Napoler                    |
#      | email     | napoler.dev@prestashop.com |
#      | password  | PrestaShopForever1_!       |
#    Then if I query customer customer "CUST-1" I should get a Customer with properties:
#      | firstName | Mathieu                    |
#      | lastName  | Napoler                    |
#      | email     | napoler.dev@prestashop.com |
#    When I edit customer "CUST-1" and I change the following properties:
#      | firstName | Jean |
#    Then if I query customer customer "CUST-1" I should get a Customer with properties:
#      | firstName | Jean |
#
#  Scenario: Fail to create a duplicate customer
#    When I create a customer "CUST-2" with following properties:
#      | firstName | Mathieu                     |
#      | lastName  | Napoler                     |
#      | email     | naapoler.dev@prestashop.com |
#      | password  | PrestaShopForever1_!        |
#    And I attempt to create a customer "CUST-3" with following properties:
#      | firstName | Mathieu                     |
#      | lastName  | Napoler                     |
#      | email     | naapoler.dev@prestashop.com |
#      | password  | PrestaShopForever1_!        |
#    Then I should be returned an error message 'Customer with email "naapoler.dev@prestashop.com" already exists'
#
#  Scenario: Create a complete customer and edit it
#    When I create a customer "CUST-4" with following properties:
