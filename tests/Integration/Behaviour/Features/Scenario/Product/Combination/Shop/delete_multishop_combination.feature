Feature: Delete combination from Back Office (BO) in multiple shops
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to delete product combinations from BO in multiple shops

  Background:
    Given language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And attribute group "Size" named "Size" in en language exists
    And attribute group "Color" named "Color" in en language exists
    And attribute "S" named "S" in en language exists
    And attribute "M" named "M" in en language exists
    And attribute "White" named "White" in en language exists
    And attribute "Black" named "Black" in en language exists
    And attribute "Blue" named "Blue" in en language exists
    And shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "default_shop_group" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And I add a shop group "test_second_shop_group" with name "Test second shop group" and color "green"
    And I add a shop "shop3" with name "test_third_shop" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And I add a shop "shop4" with name "test_shop_without_url" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And single shop context is loaded
    Given I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | universal T-shirt |
      | type        | combinations      |
    And product product1 type should be combinations
    And I generate combinations in shop "shop1" for product product1 using following attributes:
      | Size  | [S,M]              |
      | Color | [White,Black,Blue] |
    And I generate combinations in shop "shop2" for product product1 using following attributes:
      | Size  | [S,M]              |
      | Color | [White,Black,Blue] |
    And product "product1" should have following combinations for shops "shop1,shop2":
      | id reference   | combination name        | reference | attributes           | impact on price | quantity | is default |
      | product1SWhite | Size - S, Color - White |           | [Size:S,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | true       |
      | product1SBlack | Size - S, Color - Black |           | [Size:S,Color:Black] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1SBlue  | Size - S, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:S,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MWhite | Size - M, Color - White |           | [Size:M,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MBlack | Size - M, Color - Black |           | [Size:M,Color:Black] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MBlue  | Size - M, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:M,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | false      |
#    And I copy product product1 from shop shop1 to shop shop2
#    Then product "product1" localized "name" for shops "shop1,shop2" should be:
#      | locale | value       |
#      | en-US  | magic staff |
#    And product "product1" localized "description" for shops "shop1,shop2" should be:
#      | locale | value                    |
#      | en-US  | such a super magic staff |
#    And product "product1" localized "description_short" for shops "shop1,shop2" should be:
#      | locale | value             |
#      | en-US  | super magic staff |
#    And product product1 is not associated to shop shop3
#    And product product1 is not associated to shop shop4

  Scenario: Delete combinations one by one from multiple shops
#    @todo: unfinished. Only a test scenario to see if generation works for multiple shops at all
    Given product "product1" should have following combinations for shops "shop1,shop2":
      | id reference   | combination name        | reference | attributes           | impact on price | quantity | is default |
      | product1SWhite | Size - S, Color - White |           | [Size:S,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | true       |

      | product1SBlue  | Size - S, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:S,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | false      |
