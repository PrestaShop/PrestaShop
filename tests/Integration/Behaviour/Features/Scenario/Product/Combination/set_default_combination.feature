Feature: Set default combination for product in Back Office (BO)
  As an employee
  I need to be able to set default combination from BO

  Background:
    Given language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And attribute group "Size" named "Size" in en language exists
    And attribute group "Color" named "Color" in en language exists
    And attribute "S" named "S" in en language exists
    And attribute "M" named "M" in en language exists
    And attribute "L" named "L" in en language exists
    And attribute "White" named "White" in en language exists
    And attribute "Black" named "Black" in en language exists
    And attribute "Blue" named "Blue" in en language exists
    And attribute "Red" named "Red" in en language exists

  Scenario: Change default combination for product
    Given I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | universal T-shirt |
      | type        | combinations      |
    And product product1 type should be combinations
    And product product1 does not have a default combination
    When I generate combinations for product product1 using following attributes:
      | Size  | [S,M]              |
      | Color | [White,Black,Blue] |
    Then product "product1" should have following combinations:
      | id reference   | combination name        | reference | attributes           | impact on price | quantity | is default |
      | product1SWhite | Size - S, Color - White |           | [Size:S,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | true       |
      | product1SBlack | Size - S, Color - Black |           | [Size:S,Color:Black] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1SBlue  | Size - S, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:S,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MWhite | Size - M, Color - White |           | [Size:M,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MBlack | Size - M, Color - Black |           | [Size:M,Color:Black] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MBlue  | Size - M, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:M,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | false      |
    And product product1 default combination should be "product1SWhite"
    When I set combination "product1SBlue" as default
    Then product product1 default combination should be "product1SBlue"
    Then product "product1" should have following combinations:
      | id reference   | combination name        | reference | attributes           | impact on price | quantity | is default |
      | product1SWhite | Size - S, Color - White |           | [Size:S,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1SBlack | Size - S, Color - Black |           | [Size:S,Color:Black] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1SBlue  | Size - S, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:S,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | true       |
      | product1MWhite | Size - M, Color - White |           | [Size:M,Color:White] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MBlack | Size - M, Color - Black |           | [Size:M,Color:Black] | 0               | 0        | false      |
      | product1MBlue  | Size - M, Color - Blue  |           | [Size:M,Color:Blue]  | 0               | 0        | false      |
