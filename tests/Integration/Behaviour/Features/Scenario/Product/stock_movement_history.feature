Feature: Search stock movement history from Back Office (BO)
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to search stock movement history for a product from BO

  Background:
    Given email sending is disabled
    And the current currency is "USD"
    And country "US" is enabled
    And the module "dummy_payment" is installed
    And I am logged in as "test@prestashop.com" employee
    And there is customer "testCustomer" with email "pub@prestashop.com"
    And customer "testCustomer" has address in "US" country
    And a carrier "default_carrier" with name "My carrier" exists
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 17.0 and 100 items in stock

  Scenario: I can search the last 5 rows of stock movement history by default and paginate through history
    When I create an empty cart "dummy_cart1" for customer "testCustomer"
    And I select "US" address as delivery and invoice address for customer "testCustomer" in cart "dummy_cart1"
