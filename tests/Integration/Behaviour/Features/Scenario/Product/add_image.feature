Feature: Add product image from Back Office (BO)
  As an employee I need to be able to add new product image

  Scenario: Add new product image
    Given I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name       | en-US:bottle of beer |
      | is_virtual | false                |
    And product "product1" type should be standard
    And product "product1" should have no images
    When I add new product "product1" image "image1" named "app_icon.png"
    Then product "product1" should have following images:
      | image reference | is cover | legend | position |
      | image1          | true     | en-US: | 1        |
#todo: assert image types (which is not present in dummy database), assert combination & pack images
