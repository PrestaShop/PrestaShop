Feature: Update product suppliers from Back Office (BO)
  As a BO user
  I need to be able to update product suppliers from BO

  Background:

    And language "language1" with locale "en-US" exists
    And there is a currency named "currency1" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And there is a currency named "currency3" with iso code "EUR" and exchange rate of 0.63

      # Wholesale price should have been updated as well matching the new default supplier
      When I update product "product5" with following values:
        | wholesale_price  | 10    |
      # Finally, I can remove all suppliers ith one command
      When I remove all associated product product5 suppliers
      Then product product5 should not have any suppliers assigned
      And product product5 should not have a default supplier
      And product product5 default supplier reference should be empty

  Scenario: Update product suppliers without specifying the productSupplierId should also work
    Given I add product "product6" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | magic staff |
      | type        | standard    |
    And product product6 type should be standard

    And product product6 should have following supplier values:
      | default supplier           | supplier2  |
      | default supplier reference |            |
    # Update data without specifying the product supplier ID it should work as productId/supplierId is enough to match
    # an existing product supplier, we simply cannot assert that they match the provided productSupplierId since it is
    # not provided This feature is important in the form it allows performing both association of new suppliers and
    # update of such new suppliers even if we cannot know the productSupplierId in advance since it has not been created
    When I update product product6 suppliers:
      | supplier  | reference                       | currency | price_tax_excluded |
      | supplier1 | my first supplier for product6  | USD      | 10                 |
