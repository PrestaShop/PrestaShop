  As an employee I want to be able to add file of virtual product.

    Given I add product "product1" with following information:

      | type        | virtual     |
    And product "product1" should not have a file
    And product product1 type should be virtual
    And I add virtual product file "file1" to product "product1" with following details:
      | display name | puffin-logo.png |
      | file name    | app_icon.png    |
    And product "product1" should have a virtual product file "file1" with following details:
      | display name         | puffin-logo.png |
      | access days          | 0               |
      | download times limit | 0               |
      | expiration date      |                 |
    And file "file1" for product "product1" should exist in system
    When I update file "file1" with following details:
