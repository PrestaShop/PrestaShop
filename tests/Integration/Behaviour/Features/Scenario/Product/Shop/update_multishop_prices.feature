Feature: Update product price fields from Back Office (BO) for multiple shops.
  As a BO user I want to be able to update product fields associated with price for multiple shops.

  Background:
    Given I enable multishop feature
    And shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "default_shop_group" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And I add a shop group "test_second_shop_group" with name "Test second shop group" and color "green"
    And I add a shop "shop3" with name "test_third_shop" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And I add a shop "shop4" with name "test_shop_without_url" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And single shop context is loaded
    Given I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | magic staff |
      | type        | standard    |
    When I update product "product1" with following values:
      | price              | 100.99          |
      | ecotax             | 0               |
      | tax rules group    | US-AL Rate (4%) |
      | on_sale            | true            |
      | wholesale_price    | 70              |
      | unit_price         | 10              |
      | unity              | bag of ten      |
    And I copy product product1 from shop shop1 to shop shop2
    Then product product1 should have following prices information for shops "shop1,shop2":
      | price              | 100.99          |
      | price_tax_included | 105.0296        |

      | unit_price_ratio   | 10.099          |
    And product product1 is not associated to shop shop3
    And product product1 is not associated to shop shop4

  Scenario: I update product prices for a specific shop
    When I update product "product1" for shop shop2 with following values:
      | price              | 200.99            |
