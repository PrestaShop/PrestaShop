Feature: Copy product from shop to shop.
  As a BO user I want to be able to copy product from shop to shop.

  Background:
    Given I enable multishop feature
    And shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "test_second_shop" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And I add a shop group "test_second_shop_group" with name "Test second shop group" and color "green"
    And I add a shop "shop3" with name "test_third_shop" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And I add a shop "shop4" with name "test_shop_without_url" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And single shop context is loaded
    And language "french" with locale "fr-FR" exists

  Scenario: Add products in specific shop
    Given I add product "createdProduct" to shop "shop2" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | magic staff |
      | type        | standard    |
    Then product createdProduct is associated to shop shop2
    And default shop for product createdProduct is shop2
    And product createdProduct is not associated to shop shop1
    And product createdProduct is not associated to shop shop3
    And product createdProduct is not associated to shop shop4
    # Assert stock has correctly been created for the appropriate shop
    Then product "createdProduct" should have following stock information for shops "shop2":
      | pack_stock_type     | default |
      | out_of_stock_type   | default |
      | quantity            | 0       |

  Scenario: I copy product to another shop that was not associated, prices are copied
    # By default the product is created for default shop
    Given I add product "productWithPrices" with following information:
