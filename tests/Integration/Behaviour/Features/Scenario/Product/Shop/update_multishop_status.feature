Feature: Feature: Update product options from Back Office (BO) for multiple shops
  As a BO user
  I want to be able to update product fields associated with options in multiple shops.

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And manufacturer studioDesign named "Studio Design" exists
    And manufacturer graphicCorner named "Graphic Corner" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "default_shop_group" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And I add a shop group "test_second_shop_group" with name "Test second shop group" and color "green"
    And I add a shop "shop3" with name "test_third_shop" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And I add a shop "shop4" with name "test_shop_without_url" and color "blue" for the group "test_second_shop_group"
    And single shop context is loaded
    Given I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | Presta camera |
      | type        | standard      |
    And I copy product product1 from shop shop1 to shop shop2
    And I copy product product1 from shop shop1 to shop shop3
    And I copy product product1 from shop shop1 to shop shop4
    Then product "product1" should have following options for shops "shop1,shop2,shop3,shop4":
      | product option      | value |
      | visibility          | both  |
      | available_for_order | true  |
      | online_only         | false |
      | show_price          | true  |
      | condition           | new   |
      | show_condition      | false |
      | manufacturer        |       |
