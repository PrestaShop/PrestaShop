    Scenario: I can add product to a pack regardless of their common shops (or uncommon), the name depends on the shop though
      Given I add product "productPack5" to shop shop2 with following information:
        | name[en-US] | weird sunglasses box |
        | type        | pack                 |
      And product "productPack5" type should be pack for shop shop2
      And I add product "product5" to shop shop1 with following information:
        | name[en-US] | work sunglasses |
        | type        | standard        |
      And I add product "product6" to shop shop3 with following information:
        | name[en-US] | personal sunglasses |
        | type        | standard            |
      And I add product "product7" to shop shop4 with following information:
        | name[en-US] | casual sunglasses |
        | type        | standard          |
      And I copy product product7 from shop shop4 to shop shop2
      Given I update pack productPack5 with following product quantities:
        | product  | quantity |
        | product5 | 10       |
        | product6 | 11       |
        | product7 | 15       |
      Then pack "productPack5" should contain products with following details for shops "shop1,shop2,shop4":
        | product  | combination | name                | quantity | image url                                              | reference |

      And I update product "product7" for shop "shop4" with following values:
        | name[en-US]              | casual sunglasses 4 |
      Then product "product7" localized "name" for shops "shop4" should be:
        | locale | value               |
        | en-US  | casual sunglasses 4 |
      Then product "product7" localized "name" for shops "shop2" should be:
