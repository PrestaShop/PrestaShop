Feature: Add product image from Back Office (BO)
  As an employee I need to be able to add new product image in multishop context

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "default_shop_group" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And single shop context is loaded
    And I add product "product1" with following information:
      | name[en-US] | bottle of beer |
      | type        | standard       |
    And product "product1" type should be standard
    And I copy product product1 from shop shop1 to shop shop2

  Scenario: Add new product image for specific shop
    Given following image types should be applicable to products:
      | reference     | name           | width | height |
      | cartDefault   | cart_default   | 125   | 125    |
      | homeDefault   | home_default   | 250   | 250    |
      | largeDefault  | large_default  | 800   | 800    |
      | mediumDefault | medium_default | 452   | 452    |
      | smallDefault  | small_default  | 98    | 98     |
    And product "product1" should have no images
    When I add new image "image1" named "app_icon.png" to product "product1" for shop "shop1"
    Then image "image1" should have same file as "app_icon.png"
    And product "product1" should have following images for shop "shop1":
      | image reference | is cover | legend[en-US] | position | image url                            | thumbnail url                                      |
      | image1          | true     |               | 1        | http://myshop.com/img/p/{image1}.jpg | http://myshop.com/img/p/{image1}-small_default.jpg |
    When I add new image "image2" named "logo.jpg" to product "product1" for shop "shop1"
    Then image "image2" should have same file as "logo.jpg"
    And product "product1" should have following images for shop "shop1":
      | image reference | is cover | legend[en-US] | position | image url                            | thumbnail url                                      |

      | image2          | false    |               | 2        | http://myshop.com/img/p/{image2}.jpg | http://myshop.com/img/p/{image2}-small_default.jpg |
    And images "[image1, image2]" should have following types generated:
      | name           | width | height |
      | cart_default   | 125   | 125    |

      | medium_default | 452   | 452    |
      | small_default  | 98    | 98     |
