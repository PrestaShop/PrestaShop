Feature: Copy product from shop to shop.
  As a BO user I want to be able to duplicate products for specific shop, group shop and all shops

  Scenario: This are pre-requisite steps but it is only done once, that is why we don't use Background here
    Given I enable multishop feature
    # Prepare languages

    # Prepare shops
    And shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And shop group "default_shop_group" with name "Default" exists
    And I add a shop "shop2" with name "test_second_shop" and color "red" for the group "default_shop_group"
    And I add a shop group "test_second_shop_group" with name "Test second shop group" and color "green"
    And Shop group test_second_shop_group shares its stock

    And I associate attribute group "Size" with shops "shop1,shop2,shop3,shop4"
    And I associate attribute group "Color" with shops "shop1,shop2,shop3,shop4"
    And I associate attribute "S" with shops "shop1,shop2,shop3,shop4"

    And manufacturer studioDesign named "Studio Design" exists
    And I create carrier "carrier1" with specified properties:
      | name        | ecoCarrier |
    And I create carrier "carrier2" with specified properties:
      | name        | Fast carry |
    # Prepare a few data
    And I add new tax "us-tax-state-1" with following properties:
      | name       | US Tax (6%) |
      | rate       | 6           |

      | name    | US Tax group |
      | country | US           |
