Feature: Add cart rule
  PrestaShop allows BO users to edit cart rules
  As a BO user
  I must be able to edit cart rules

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And there is a currency named "chf" with iso code "CHF" and exchange rate of 1.25
    And currency "usd" is the default one
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And attribute group "Size" named "Size" in en language exists
    And attribute group "Color" named "Color" in en language exists
    And attribute "S" named "S" in en language exists
    And attribute "M" named "M" in en language exists
    And attribute "White" named "White" in en language exists
    And I create cart rule "cart_rule_1" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                      | cart rule 1         |
