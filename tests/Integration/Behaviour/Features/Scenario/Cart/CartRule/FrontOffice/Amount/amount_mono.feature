  As a customer
  I must be able to have correct cart total when adding cart rules

  Background:
    Given there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 19.812 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product2" with a price of 32.388 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product3" with a price of 31.188 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a cart rule "reduction_5_dollar" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                  | reduces $5             |
      | priority                     | 4                      |
      | free_shipping                | false                  |

      | discount_currency            | usd                    |
      | discount_includes_tax        | false                  |
    And there is a cart rule "reduction_500_dollar" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                  | reduces $500           |
      | priority                     | 5                      |
      | free_shipping                | false                  |
      | code                         | reduce-500             |
      | discount_amount              | 500                    |
