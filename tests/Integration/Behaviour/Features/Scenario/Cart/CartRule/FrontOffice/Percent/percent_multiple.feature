Feature: Cart rule (percent) calculation with multiple cart rules
  As a customer
  I must be able to have correct cart total when adding cart rules

  Background:
    Given there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 19.812 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product2" with a price of 32.388 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product3" with a price of 31.188 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a cart rule "cartrule2" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                  | cartrule2              |
      | total_quantity               | 1000                   |
      | quantity_per_user            | 1000                   |

      | discount_percentage          | 10                     |
    And I have an empty default cart

  Scenario: one product in cart, quantity 1, 2x % global cartRules
    Given I add 1 items of product "product1" in my cart
    And my cart total shipping fees should be 7.0 tax included

    Then my cart total should be 15.92 tax included
    And the current cart should have the following contextual reductions:
      | reference | reduction |
      | cartrule2 | 9.905     |

  Scenario: one product in cart, one cart rule free shipping, one cart rule 10%
    When I add 1 items of product "product1" in my cart
    # checking cart total and shipping before cart rules exists, to assert that shipping price will be reduced later
    # because when ONLY_SHIPPING is calculated it does not count cart rules
    And my cart total shipping fees should be 7.0 tax included

      | discount_percentage          | 10                     |
    # now adding same products just with cart rules and checking the order total is correct (shipping and percentage applied)
    When I add 1 items of product "product1" in my cart
    And my cart total should be precisely 17.83 tax included
    And the current cart should have the following contextual reductions:
      | reference    | reduction |
      | freeshipping | 7         |
      | 10percent    | 1.981     |
