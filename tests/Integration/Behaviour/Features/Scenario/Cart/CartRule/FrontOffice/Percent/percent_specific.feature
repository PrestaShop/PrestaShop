Feature: Cart rule (percent) calculation with one cart rule restricted to one product
  As a customer
  I must be able to have correct cart total when adding cart rules

  Background:
    Given there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    And shop configuration for "PS_CART_RULE_FEATURE_ACTIVE" is set to 1
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product1" with a price of 19.812 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product2" with a price of 32.388 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a product in the catalog named "product3" with a price of 31.188 and 1000 items in stock
    And there is a cart rule "cartrule10" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                  | cartrule10             |
      | priority                     | 10                     |
      | free_shipping                | false                  |
      | code                         | foo10                  |
      | discount_percentage          | 50                     |
    And cart rule "cartrule10" is restricted to product "product2"
    And there is a cart rule "cartrule11" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                  | cartrule11             |
      | priority                     | 11                     |
      | free_shipping                | false                  |
      | code                         | foo11                  |
      | discount_percentage          | 10                     |
    And cart rule "cartrule11" is restricted to product "product2"
    And I have an empty default cart
