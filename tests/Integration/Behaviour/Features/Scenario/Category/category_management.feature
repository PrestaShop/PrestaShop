Feature: Category Management
  PrestaShop allows BO users to manage categories for products
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create, edit and delete categories in my shop

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    And language "en" with locale "en-US" exists
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    And language "fr" with locale "fr-FR" exists
    And category "home" in default language named "Home" exists
    And category "root" in default language named "Root" exists
    And category "root" is the root category and it cannot be edited
    And single shop context is loaded
    And category "home" is set as the home category for shop "shop1"
    And category "home-accessories" in default language named "Home Accessories" exists
    And category "clothes" in default language named "Clothes" exists
    And group "visitorGroup" named "Visitor" exists
    And group "guestGroup" named "Guest" exists
    And group "customerGroup" named "Customer" exists

  # We cannot test the actual image upload due to its dependency from real HTTP upload,
  # but we can mimic the upload and test EditableCategory construct and images deletion
  Scenario: Assert and delete category cover image
    Given I add new category "category18" with following details:
      | name[en-US]         | not important |
      | name[fr-FR]         | not important |
      | active              | true          |
      | parent category     | home          |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
    And category "category18" should not have a cover image
    When I upload cover image "cover1" named "app_icon.png" to category "category18"
    # @todo: asserting image details is too much for current PR scope.
    # each category image is actually a regenerated thumbnail with a timestamp (is that expected?).
    # It is not so easy to test it, because it looks something like this:
    # ['size' => '19.187kB', 'path' => '/img/tmp/category_29.jpg?time=1668089857']
    Then category "category18" should have a cover image
    When I delete cover image for category "category18"
    Then category "category18" should not have a cover image
    And image "cover1" should not exist

  Scenario: Assert category thumbnail image
    # @todo: there seems to be no command for thumbnail deletion (is it intentional or forgotten?)
    Given I add new category "category19" with following details:
      | name[en-US]         | not important |
      | name[fr-FR]         | not important |
      | active              | true          |
      | parent category     | home          |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
    And category "category19" should not have a thumbnail image
    When I upload thumbnail image "thumb1" named "app_icon.png" to category "category19"
    Then category "category19" should have a thumbnail image

  # enabled seems to be the same as displayed
  Scenario: Update category status
    Given I add new category "category21" with following details:
      | name[en-US]         | not important |
      | name[fr-FR]         | not important |

      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
    And category "category21" is disabled
    When I enable category "category21"
    Then category "category21" is enabled
    When I disable category "category21"
    Then category "category21" is disabled

  Scenario: Update category status using bulk action
    Given I add new category "category22" with following details:
      | name[en-US]         | not important |

      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |

      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
      | link rewrite[en-US] | not-important |
    When I bulk enable categories "category22,category23"
    Then category "category22" is enabled
    And category "category23" is enabled
    When I bulk disable categories "category22,category23"
    Then category "category22" is disabled
    And category "category23" is disabled
    When I enable category "category22"
    And I bulk disable categories "category22,category23"
    Then category "category22" is disabled
    And category "category23" is disabled
    When I enable category "category23"
    And I bulk enable categories "category22,category23"
    Then category "category22" is enabled
