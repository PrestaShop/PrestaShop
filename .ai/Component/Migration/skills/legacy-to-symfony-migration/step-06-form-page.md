# Step 6 — Form page (vertical slice)

This step produces a complete, demoable add/edit page in one go. Like the listing slice (step 5), every layer needed for the form — type, data flow, controller, routing, template, JS — is built and wired here.

Read `@.ai/Component/Forms/CONTEXT.md`, `@.ai/Component/Controller/CONTEXT.md`, `@.ai/Component/Twig/CONTEXT.md`, `@.ai/Component/Javascript/CONTEXT.md` for the conventions of each layer.

## Slice ordering reminder

If listing (step 5) ran first, the controller class and routing YAML already exist — this slice **extends** them with form actions and form routes. If this slice runs first (rare), it creates the controller class and routing YAML; step 5 then extends them later. Both invocations of `create-controller-*` and `create-admin-routing` are designed to support either case.

## Settings forms vs CRUD forms

Before picking skills, classify each form block on the page (a single admin page can carry both):

- **Settings form** (a.k.a. options block, `fields_options`): persists into `ps_configuration`. No entity ID. No CQRS Add/Edit command. Use the [`create-settings-form`](../../../Forms/skills/create-settings-form/SKILL.md) umbrella skill — it produces the DataConfiguration + FormDataProvider + FormType + service entries in one go. Do **not** invoke `create-crud-form-*` skills for this block.
- **CRUD form** (a.k.a. identifiable form): entity add/edit with a grid listing. Use the CRUD chain below.

Pages with **both** patterns (e.g. *Shop parameters > Contact > Stores* has a CRUD grid for store entities and a settings form for global contact details) need both flows — run them independently.

## Skills to invoke — CRUD form

In suggested order:

| Skill | Produces |
|---|---|
| `create-crud-form-type` | `{Domain}Type` extending `TranslatorAwareType`, with each field mapped from the manifest |
| `create-form-tab-layout` | `NavigationTabType`-based tab structure — **conditional, complex pages only**. Most pages do not use tabs. |
| `create-crud-form-data-handling` | `DataProvider` (loads `Editable{Domain}` for edit) + `DataHandler` (dispatches Add/Edit + sub-resource commands) + DI registration |
| `create-controller-form-actions` | `createAction`, `editAction` using `FormBuilder` + `FormHandler` injected as action arguments. Creates the controller class on first slice, extends it on second. |
| `create-admin-routing` | Form routes (`create`, `edit`, plus any custom action). Carries `_legacy_feature_flag: {domain}` on each route. Creates YAML on first slice, extends on second. |
| `create-twig-form-template` | `form.html.twig` and any form theme overrides |
| `create-ts-entry-point` | `js/pages/{domain}/form.ts` + webpack entry for the form |
| `init-js-components` | `initComponents()` calls for translatable inputs, choice trees, TinyMCE editors, etc. — driven by `data-*` attributes in the form template |
| `create-vue-component` | Vue SFC for sections that need rich interactivity beyond standard JS components — **exception only**. Most pages do not need Vue. |

## Skills to invoke — settings form

In suggested order:

| Skill | Produces |
|---|---|
| `create-settings-form` | DataConfiguration (extends `AbstractMultistoreConfiguration`) + FormDataProvider + FormType + 4 service YAML entries — the entire settings stack in one skill. **Never produces a custom `FormHandler` class**: the base `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Form\Handler` is registered as a service. |
| `create-controller-form-actions` | The settings-form action (index passes `$formHandler->getForm()->createView()` to the view, save action calls `$formHandler->save($form->getData())`). Uses the `use ... FormHandlerInterface as ConfigurationFormHandlerInterface;` aliasing trick to disambiguate from the IdentifiableObject handler. |
| `create-admin-routing` | The save route (POST to `admin_{page}_save_options`). |
| `create-twig-form-template` | The settings block template (one `form_start`/`form_end` per block, explicit `action: path('...')`, submit button outside `form_widget`). |

## Orchestration notes

- `FormBuilder` and `FormHandler` are injected as **action arguments** (Symfony argument resolver), not in the constructor. This is the preferred order across PrestaShop controllers; reserve `getSubscribedServices` for services shared across many actions, and constructor injection only when neither fits.
- The `DataProvider`/`DataHandler` pair is the standard for forms whose data round-trips through CQRS commands. For one-off actions that do not fit this pattern, dispatching a command directly from the controller is acceptable — the pattern is not mandatory for every action.
- Sub-resource commands are dispatched separately by the `DataHandler` after the main Add/Edit command — never inline them in `EditXxxCommand`.
- Form theme overrides may be declared either via `{% form_theme %}` in the Twig file or via the PrestaShop-specific `'form_theme'` form option (preferred today). Pick one location per form.
- Tab layout is the exception: only invoke `create-form-tab-layout` when the manifest's complexity decision called for it. The default form is single-column, no tabs.

## Parity pass

"The page renders and saves" does not show that it behaves like the page it replaces. Before the gate, run each line of the manifest's behaviour parity checklist on both pages, the legacy one with the feature flag off and the migrated one with it on, and read the result **from the database**, not from the flash message: a save that changed nothing still reports success. At least:

- save an untouched edit form: the stored row, and any serialized field, is identical byte for byte
- clear each optional field and save: the stored value is empty on both sides
- the boundary inputs of the checklist: a whole number where decimals are expected, a locale decimal (`48,8566`), `0`, a value the widget cannot render (more slots than it shows)
- submit the form without the JavaScript, with a required field removed from the payload: a field error, not a generic flash and not a 500
- save the options block: every configuration key reads back with the same value format on both sides
- the legacy URLs (`index.php?controller=Admin{Domain}&update{table}&{identifier}=1`, `&add{table}`) land on the migrated pages

A difference is either fixed, or it is a **change** line of the checklist, listed in the PR description.

## Gate to next step

- [ ] With flag enabled, the create page renders and saves
- [ ] With flag enabled, the edit page renders, prefills, and saves
- [ ] Validation errors map to translatable flash messages
- [ ] Sub-resource updates (if any) persist through the appropriate sub-resource commands
- [ ] File uploads (if any) work and survive a re-edit, in every image format the legacy page generated
- [ ] Parity pass run: every checklist line matches legacy, or is a **change** line listed in the PR description
- [ ] With flag disabled, the legacy form still loads (no regression)
