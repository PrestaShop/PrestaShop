 * On PrestaShop 1.7.6.0, two new columns have been introduced in the PREFIX_currency table: precision & numeric_iso_code
 * A fresh install would add the proper data in these columns, however an upgraded shop to 1.7.6.0 would not get the
 * corresponding values of each currency.
 * 
 * This upgrade script will cover this need by loading the CLDR data and update the currency if it still has the default table values.
